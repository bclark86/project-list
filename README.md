Overview
========

This repository acts as a centralized hub to link to various personal
projects developed in my pursuit of knowledge in the world of applied
statistics, analytics, machine learning.

Wedding Guest Risk Modeling
---------------------------

I looked to combine elements of statistical simulation, risk analytics,
and design thinking to build a product that will extend a single example
use-case into a flexible product that others can use.

Business Analytics Case Studies
-------------------------------

Use of predictive analytics to develop value-driven machine learning
solutions to various business problems. Both R and Python are used to
work through the modeling process.

Reports are located
[here](https://github.com/bclark86/business-analytics).

Applied Statistics
------------------

The goal of these mini-projects is to apply various statistical concepts
to real-world data to answer questions through experimentation.

Mini-projects are located [here](https://github.com/bclark86/stats-fun).

Misc. Projects
--------------

These are mini-projects Iâ€™ve completed to answer random questions and/or
apply a new skill.
